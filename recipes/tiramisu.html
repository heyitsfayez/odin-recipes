        <h2>Classic tiramisu, will never go out of style</h2>
        
        <p>This tiramisu recipe shows you how to 
            make the classic Italian layered 
            dessert at home with rum-flavored, 
            coffee-soaked ladyfingers, a creamy 
            mascarpone custard, and whipped cream. 
            The top of this tiramisu is dusted with 
            cocoa powder for an impressive no-bake 
            dessert.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>       
            <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 pound mascarpone cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>¼ cup strong brewed coffee, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rum</li>
            <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ladyfinger cookies</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together egg yolks and sugar 
                in a medium saucepan until well 
                blended. Whisk in milk and cook 
                over medium heat, stirring 
                constantly, until mixture comes 
                to a boil.</li>
            <li>Boil gently for 1 minute, then 
                remove from the heat and allow to 
                cool slightly.</li>
            <li> Cover tightly and chill in the 
                refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Beat cream and vanilla in a medium 
                bowl with an electric mixer until 
                stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Remove egg yolk mixture from the 
                refrigerator; add mascarpone 
                cheese and whisk until smooth.</li>
            <li>Combine coffee and rum in a small 
                bowl. Split ladyfingers in half 
                lengthwise and drizzle with the 
                coffee mixture.</li>
            <li>Arrange 1/2 of the soaked 
                ladyfingers in the bottom of a 
                7x11-inch dish. Spread 1/2 of the 
                mascarpone mixture over the 
                ladyfingers, then spread 1/2 of 
                the whipped cream over top. 
                Repeat layers once more. 
                Sprinkle cocoa powder over top.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate until set, 
                4 to 6 hours</li>
        </ol>
